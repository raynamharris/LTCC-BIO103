Which type of cell is responsible for making antibodies?

1. T-lymphocytes
1. **B-lymphocytes**
1. Macrophages
1. Basophils

Antibodies are produced by the adaptive immune system and respond to antigens presented by a pathogen. The antigen-antibody complex is then detected by cytotoxic T-cells, which destroy the infected cell. The antibodies are created by B-lymphocytes, which can differentiate when exposed to a specific pathogen. Differentiated B-lymphocytes known as plasma cells are responsible for the mass production of certain antibodies. Macrophages are derived from monocytes and serve as phagocytes in the innate immune response. Basophils are also part of the innate immune response and, along with mast cells, produce histamine to initiate the inflammatory response.

Which cell is necessary in order to allow B-lymphoytes to differentiate into plasma cells and memory B-cells? 

1. Cytotoxic T-cells
1. **Helper T-cells**
1. Eosinophils
1. Macrophages

Helper T cells are arguably the most important cells in adaptive immunity, as they are required for almost all adaptive immune responses. They not only help activate B cells to secrete antibodies and macrophages to destroy ingested microbes, but they also help activate cytotoxic T cells to kill infected target cells. 

Which immune cell is part of acquired immunity?

1. Macrophage
1. Neutrophil
1. **Plasma cell**
1. Eosinophil

Acquired immunity is developed in the body following a previously encountered infection. The innate immunity is, by definition, always present in the body and is used to attack all general forms of infection. The granulocyte cells are considered part of innate immunity and help mediate the immune response against foreign pathogens. These cells include basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, and macrophages (which are differentiated from monocytes).The adaptive immune response involves the production of antibodies against specific target antigens. Plasma cells are an integral part of the adaptive response and secrete large volumes of antibodies in response to a secondary infection by a previously encountered pathogen. T-cells and B-cells are also part of the adaptive response. Eosinophil are white blood cells.
