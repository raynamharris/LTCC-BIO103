- Classify elements of the innate and adaptive immune systems
- Explain how animal cells recognize invading microbes
- Defend the use of vaccines to protect against infectious diseases

## Pre-Lesson Quiz

Understanding how we develop immunity is critical to understanding how vaccines work. You may have learned about innate and adaptive immunity in previous classes or through the news. 

**Can you label elements of the innate and adaptive immune systems in this illustration from memory?**

<figcaption><b>Innate and adaptive immune responses. </b>Innate immune responses are activated directly by pathogens and defend all multicellular organisms against infection. In vertebrates, pathogens, together with the innate immune responses they activate, stimulate adaptive immune responses, which then help fight the infection. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21070/figure/A4420/">Molecular Biology of the Cell (4th edition)</a><p></p></figcaption>

<figcaption><b>One way in which the innate immune system helps activate the adaptive immune system.</b> Specialized phagocytic cells of the innate immune system, including macrophages (not shown) and dendritic cells ingest invading microbes or their products at the site of infection. The dendritic cells then mature and migrate in lymphatic vessels to a nearby lymph node, where they serve as antigen-presenting cells. The antigen-presenting cells display microbial antigens, whole or fragmented biomolecules from the invading pathogen, to T cells in the lymph node. The some of the activated T cells then migrate to the site of infection and target microbes/cells displaying the target antigen upon their surface. One unique feature of the antigen-presenting cells is a special proteins on their surface (called costimulatory molecules) that help activate the T cells. The costimulatory molecules appear on dendritic cells only after these cells mature in response to invading microbes. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26921/figure/A4427/">Molecular Biology of the Cell (4th edition)</a><p></p></figcaption>

## Only in vertebrates?

Many older publications state that the adaptive immune response is a feature found only in vertebrates. However, the discovery of CRISPR, an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, disproved that theory. CRISPR-CAS9 is the adaptive immunity of prokaryotes in response to viruses. This family of DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea led to the [2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/summary/) and is part of the great understanding that adaptive immunity in microorganisms.

## Post Lesson Group Activities 

- **SciComm**: Explain to your neighbor why it takes longer for an unvaccinated person to mount an adaptive immune response to the coronavirus compared to a vaccinated person, all other factors considered equal. 
- **Biochem/Statics**: Discuss an experiment to test if there are any significant genetic or environmental factors influencing the response between two populations. 
- **Health/Environmental**: Compare and contrast the immune response of stressed and non-stressed individuals with those of immune-deficient individuals.
- **Evolution**: Discuss what might happen to the efficacy of a vaccine if the microbe mutates.
