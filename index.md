## Pre-Lesson Quiz

Understanding how we develop immunity is critical to understanding how vaccines work. You may have learned about innate and adaptive immunity in previous classes or through the news. 

**Can you label elements of the innate and adaptive immune systems in this illustration from memory?**

Choose from the following: 
- Antigen-presenting cell 
- B cell 
- Cytotoxic T cell 
- Destroyed cell 
- Memory B and T cells 
- SARS-CoV-2 
- T-helper cell

## Mechanisms of Innate and Adaptive Immunity

Innate immune responses are activated directly by pathogens. Innate immune responses and previously-encountered pathogens stimulate adaptive immune responses to help fight the infection. How does the innate immune system activate the adaptive immune system?

## Group Activities 

- Explain to your neighbor why it takes longer for an unvaccinated person to mount an adaptive immune response to the coronavirus compared to a vaccinated person. 
- Compare and contrast the immune response of healthy and immune-deficient individuals.
- Discuss what might happen to the efficacy of a vaccine if the microbe mutates.
